AppBundler is an Ant task for packaging up Desktop Java apps as native
executables.  It can package Mac OS X .app bundles, Windows EXEs, JNLPs,
and double clickable jars that work anywhere.

To use AppBundler, create a bundle.xml in your project directory like this:

<app name="SimpleTest">
    <jar name="simpletest.jar" 
        main-class="com.joshondesign.appbundler.simpletest.Main"/>
    <jar name="XMLLib.jar"/>
</app>

The bundle.xml lists the jars which make up your app. The jar with your main
class must have a 'main-class' attribute.

Now create an ant target in your build.xml that looks like this:

<target name='package-app' depends='build'>
    <taskdef name='appbundler' 
        classname='com.joshondesign.appbundler.BundlerTask'
        classpath='build/classes;lib/XMLLib.jar'/>
        
    <appbundler
        bundle="bundle.xml"
        target="mac"
        destdir="dist"
        libdir="build/jars;lib"
    />
</target>

That's it. Just run 'ant package-app' and a Mac bundle will appear in dist/mac.

Valid targets are mac, win, jnlp, onejar, and all.

'bundle', 'target', 'destdir', and 'libdir' must be set. 'libdir' is a semicolon
separated list of directories which contain your jars.
